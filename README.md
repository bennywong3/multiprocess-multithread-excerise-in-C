# multiprocess-multithread-excerise-in-C

This is the backup of the exercise done in C.

For multiprocess exercise, Shared Memory, Signals and wait() are used. Also a Parallel 4-way Merge-sort using Fork() and Shared Memory is made.

For multithread exercise, multithreaded program in C with pthreads simulating the production process of Tesla electric cars is made.
